EFMNB Prompt Optimizer is a Streamlit tool that analyzes prompts across five dimensions and improves them using a deterministic PCV pipeline powered by Gemini. It performs EFMNB scoring, visualizes results, and runs a 12-step Proposer–Critic–Verifier loop to generate clearer, safer, and more structured prompts.
